### Introduction

This repository contains the resources that are required to be submitted for the Course Project within the Getting & Cleaning Data (getdata-011) course of the Coursera Data Science Specialisation offered by John Hopkins University.

The script, data file and code book represent the submission for the course project for student, Josh Venman for the course commencing Feb 2nd, 2015.

In this example we introduce the `<<-` operator which can be used to
assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the

current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a
special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.

This text file is the result of Step 4 of the project where

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
cache the inverse of a matrix.

### Understanding these resources

Write the following functions:
